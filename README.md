RealNex AI Chatbot üöÄ
Welcome to the RealNex AI Chatbot, a cutting-edge, sci-fi-inspired interface that makes interacting with RealNex a thrilling experience! With two powerful personalities‚ÄîMaverick for Q&A and Goose for data import preparation‚Äîthis chatbot combines futuristic design with seamless functionality. Featuring neon gradients, glowing animations, and a cyberpunk aesthetic, it‚Äôs not just a tool‚Äîit‚Äôs an adventure.
Features üåå

Futuristic UI: Neon gradients, glowing effects, and smooth animations for an immersive experience.
Maverick Personality: Answers RealNex questions using a knowledge base, with fallback to xAI for general insights.
Goose Personality: Extracts data from files (images, PDFs, spreadsheets), maps it to RealNex CRM fields using the V1 API, and prepares it for manual import, with a snapshot of the mapped data.
CRM Token Security: Data processing requires a RealNex CRM token; without one, users can only ask questions. Token persists in localStorage for convenience, with a "Clear Token" option.
Drag-and-Drop Uploads: Upload files with a pulsating drop zone, plus camera and photo library support.
Cyberpunk Gauges: Track upload and normalization progress with neon-styled gauges.
Responsive Design: Optimized for all devices with a sleek, modern layout.
